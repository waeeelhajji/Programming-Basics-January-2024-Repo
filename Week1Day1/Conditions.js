// Conditions like they are chekpoints in video game + 18


// if statments

// if statments is the simplest way and form of conditions. you provide it with a condition (the equivalant of "Do I have the Key item?"), and it checks if that condition is true. if it is, the code inside the if statment runs.

var keyItem = true

if (keyItem == true){
    console.log("Welcome to the Game ")
}
